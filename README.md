# Overview
This will be my jounrnal, where I will document the requirements, learning processes and contributions that I've taken. As you can see my the creation, and commit dates I have not been a very dudiligent student when it comes to entering my information, and I'll be needing to write most of it down now. I would like to make a quick side note, that a majority of my efforts in the community project was spent on the pattern library, as I let my anxiety get the better of me.

## Community Project
The community project that I've decided to work on was [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) which I was introduced to via a youtuber named [Theo - t3.gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-CSgoCgsk) => [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-CSgoCgsk). "Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe systems that scale!" - [Gleam Wbsite](https://gleam.run/).

Initially, I wanted to do my community project using Kotlin, as it was a language that we're required to learn in DGL - 114, but after scowering github looking for some potential communities to take part in, I came up empty. That was, until I found Gleam.

There are tons of programming languages out there, what makes gleam so special? Well, to be honest, I'm not overly familiar with the different kinds of languages, nor what makes a language good. for starters, one thing I don't like about Gleam is that it uses implicit returns from functions, and I would much rather use explicit returns. A really cool thing about this language that I've never seen in another language I've used are pipelines, which use the `pipe operator` `|>` to pass down function calls. I don't fully understand the workings of pipes, but from what I gather they reduce the need to create additional variables when mutating stuff.

Code in `Elixir` _I've never written a line of elixir, nor seen it before until today_
```elixir
# Written by chatGPT because I couldn't figure out how to make this example with js.
# With pipes
def async_function(query) do
    query
    |> fetch()
    |> parse_response()
  end
# Without pipes
def async_function(query) do
    response = fetch(query)
    parse_response(response)
end
```
Wow, I must not understand Pipes if I'm needing to use chatGPT to generate me code, and you're absolutely correct! As they're not somthing I use, I have almost ZERO idea about how to use them, but I think the **concept** of them is REALLY COOL!  And yeah, in this example having implicit returns is more human readable than having explicit returns _blah blah blah_.

Another reason why I want to work with Gleam is because of their mascot [Lucy](https://gleam.run/images/lucy/lucy.svg) who's a clumsy little starfish who loves Strawberry Ice Cream; I mean with a mascot that amazing why wouldn't I?

But, the actual main reason I want to take part of this Community is because of the Repo/Org owner [Louis Pilford @Ipil](https://github.com/lpil).  I've read a lot of Issue conversations, like a lot, and in every single one I could not find a single one where he isn't anything but incredibly kind, friendly and encouraging. Even in Issues that I thought seemed silly, he talked through the issue with incredible patience. That was just very inspiring, as someone who has extreme anxiety, moreso when it comes to contributing to others work, as I don't want to be a hinderance. And I guess I should've known how this community was going to be, based on just this image that is clearly plastered on their home page.

So after seeing all this I really wanted to help be part of this community, even if only from the shadows!
