# Week 10

## Pattern Library
So I've visited the Pattern Library repo, and I've selected two potential Issues to contribute to. [Issue #19 License](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues/19) and [Issue #40 Kotlin Observeral Pattern](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/40). Both of these are out of my comfort zone for a few different reasons. 1: I don't know a thing about Licenses, so that requires research and 2: I don't know a thing about kotlin or an observer pattern, so that requires research. Sure, there was a short demo on how it works in one of the video lectures, but I don't fully understand it, nor do I understand it enough to make a viable contribution to the repo. SO :sparkles: Research Time! :sparkels:

## Community Project
OK so there has been some advancedment with this! I've done a 180 and will no longer be contributing to a `kotlin` community. Instead, I saw this video from a youtuber named [Theo - t3â€¤gg ](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) about an open source community called [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam). The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I-CSgoCgsk&t=1s) was super cool and informative, and got me real jazzed to start contributing to open source communities again! I've started looking through the issues on Github, and I'm kinda at a complete loss. I don't know how to contribute meaningfully to any of these issues, as a lot of them are beyond my understanding. There are a lot of unknown things like Pipes, and __types__?! `confused.js`, `confused.php` ~~confused.java~~. Still, I'm not very discourages, especially seeing how kind the owner of the repo [Ipil](https://github.com/lpil) is when responding. They have a very clear [Code OF Conduct](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam?tab=coc-ov-file) **SPOILER** My PR got merged: https://gleam.run/news/. How does past me know this? Cause past me is future me writing in past me's POV. **SPOILER END**
