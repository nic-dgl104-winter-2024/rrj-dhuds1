## Full Throttle

### Pattern Library
Things have really started picking up with the Pattern Library! I've completed my first [Issue Kotlin Observer](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/40), and I've taken on a second [Issue PHP Observer](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/pull/48). I've honeslty CRUSHED my second issue, and I manage to complete it in a few hours! Why did it take so long? Because I wrote and INCREDIBLE complicated application, that I then SCRAPPED because I was overcomplicating it. As I mentioned earlier, I OVER COMPLICATE SH*T. But after toning it down, its working as intended, and I'm very happy with my Contribution! I've also started replying to different PRs, One: because you've asked us to help review others code, and I like doing code review. Two: I'm hoping that if I respond to peoples PRs they'll feel incentivised to reply to mine! **SPOILER** No one did, and it makes me very sad **SPOILER END**

I've read and replied to basically every PR that has been created at this time, but I won't bore you with the specifics.

### Community Project
I've still not made a contribution to my community. I've consistenly read the issues, and I've attempted to solve some issues but with no luck so far. I haven't written code, I was moreso figuring out where to even start with solving some issues. One was a compiler error message, basically the compiler was giving an unhelpful error message "it was suggesting something that wasn't in scope" and the Issue asked us, the people, to make the compiler show a better, more helpful error message. I spent a good, 30+ minutes navigating the files just to look for where the compiler weas, why? Cause IDK how compilers work, or where they're kept or how error handling works. I finally found the file, and then I found the exact spot the message was displaying. How? Using firefox: find/search for keywork :cool: Anyways, all that to say my sleuthing was all for not, as after I started reading more deeply into the converstation, the F*** FILE THAT I NEEDED WAS PROVIDED BY THE REPO OWNER. UGHHHHHHHH. --ps. I don't know if it was in this issue or another issue it was provided, I forgo. But it was found only a moment after my "wheres Waldo moment."

Needless to say, I didn't contribute to anything today, or this week. But I tried. I really, really tried. --ps. I forgot the issue number, silly me.
