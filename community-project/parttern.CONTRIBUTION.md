Heads up, I'm a little self deprecating for humour purposes, why? Das just me 🤷‍♀️

## Overview
My contribution on this repo is a lot more than my contributions on the Community Project Part 1. There are a few different reasons on why, but the main reason is that I found this to be a lot more approachable, in terms of interacting with the community. When it comes to code reviews, I'm an absolute huge fan of them, and I love partaking in them. Do people critizie your baby? Yes. 😸 Is it melicious? Hopefully, not...😟 The reasons I love code reviews so much is because you can arguable learn more from reviewing, and parting in reviewing others code than you can having people review your own. As an examplem, sometimes I don't understand why people take certain approaches, but what better way to understand than by explaning what you're used to, and then having them explain why they chose certain methods in return. With all this in mind, I felt like I was able to engage with members of the class, and discuss their code in a relatively non-judgemental fashion. To be honest, initially I was worried that my reviews/question/comments would be precieved negatively, I'm not always the best at 'sugar coating' or 'shit-sandwhiching' my words. But after having the first few people respond with positivity/openeness, my concerns fadded and I felt a sense of excitement!

## Reviews
I don't remeber which PRs I reviewed, but I know that I reviewed A LOT. And not to toot my own horn, but I definitly did not review the least.😏 _finally, I'm not the bottom of the class at somethign!_ And I'm sure you've seen my name in more than a few PR comments, even if you don't know which ones. I can hope anyways...😟 I learned a lot from those reviews, and even made an active attempt at reviewing PR's in languages I didn't know. Although my feedback wasn't always the best, nor the most helpful, my hopes were that it would at least provide the individual making the PR feel as though their work has been acknoledged. Sadly, my PRs were never reviewed, aside from you.😢 That's one complaint about this project, is that my PRs got zero reviews. Here I was, **judging** 👩‍⚖️ up a storm _not really_ and I woulda thought someone would've judged me in return!🙄 For that reason, I didn't feel like my learning outcome was as much as it could've have been, outside of learning how an observer pattern works, in regards to my own pushes. That being said, I feel like my learning was greatly influenced by my reviews. And, I am very confident in my PHP reviews, because despite my negative experience with the PHP class, I LOVE PHP. Not as much as I love coffee ☕, or sleep 🛌, or chocolate 🍫, or rubiks cubes 🧊, well maybe equally to that, but you get the jist.😆

## Conclusion
This project was an absolute ton of fun! I really wish this was a course long project, and we cut out MITAI2, mainly because I really dislike MITAI2. Why do I dislike MITAI2? Look at my grade, its a zero! "But isn't it a zero because you we're a non dudiligent student who submitted the assignment late?" pffft, SEMATICS!🥸

Although my learning experience with the code that contributed to this project wasn't as much as I would've like it to be, I learned loads from PRs. I also really appreciate the opportunity to help manage some of the surfice level github stuff, and irregardless of intentions, the gesture was really heart warming. I'll most likely be seeing you next year for a retake, hehe the consequences of my actions, But I'll look forwards to the repo! Well, even if I don't have to retake the class, that's chill too. I'd honestly prefer that! No no no, you're a great instructor and I'd be happy to take your class again 😅 I just don't want to use MITAI2 anymore 💀 Eh, we can figure something out 😉

P.S. If I cannot laugh at my own short comings, I cannot grow lol.
P.S.S I don't normally use emojis/emotes, but I felt as though it was appropriate
