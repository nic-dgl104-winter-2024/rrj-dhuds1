## Community Project Contributions --Finally
So Finally, after having hemming and hawing I took the leap and contributed something to the [Gleam Community](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam)! Well, more specifically, to their [website repo](https://github.com/gleam-lang/website)! After searching through [Gleam Lang](https://github.com/gleam-lang) I happened apon the website repo, and was IMMEDIATLY ready to start! First things first, I looked through the Issues tab, and lone and behold; there wasn't really any issues that I thought I could help with. A lot of the issues seemed complex, or like things I didn't know how to do, that was until I saw [Fly.io #354](https://github.com/gleam-lang/website/issues/354). Essentially, the dark background made fly.io's logo look very bad.

So I was determined, to help right this wrong, fix this contrast issue, and make *insert UI/UX/Designer prof* proud and fix this issue! The only problem was, HOW TF DO I EVEN GET THIS THING TO RUN?

So off I began on this thankless quest, searching for the answers of getting the gleam website to run locally on my computer. First step: install `Ruby`. Not so hard, next step: run `gem install github-pages` Ok so far so good! Uh-oh errors. Wait, no stop, why SO MANY ERRORS?! Ok I'll just google it! _how to get ruby to work with github-pages_ Uh-huh, that's not helpful, no I don't want this, or this. or this... OK, _how to run website on ruby_ I don't want mac, _how to rub website on ruby windows_ Ok, `Step 1: install ruby on rails` Ok simple! `Step 2: install Ruby again because ruby on railses ruby is out of date.` Annoying but ok, `Step four install bundler` ok, im on this website and I'm confused _copies code from 'Getting Started'_ and it doesn't work... next tutorial `Install Yarn, NPM, RUBY` I have 2/3 already installed, so i'll get yarn. Now install `WINGW-32` then go to `bin` copy `file-path`, go to `view advanced system settings` click `enviorment variables` then `add` then `paste` and  then I blacked out with confusion. BUT ITS OK WE GOT IT WORKING, I then needed to use a command to change `WINGW-32 make` to just `make`. Finally, after all these problems, _half of them untold, time spent over an hour_ I was finally able to run `gem install github-pages` and `gem install webrick`! I forked the repo, opened it up in github, and ran the final command in the terminal, `make serve` and it ran without errors! Or success?.. Ok I'll run it again, still nothing. OK? _localhost:3000_ and! nothing... What does `make serve` call? uh-huh, ok so it calls `jekyll server --watch --safe --port 3000 --drafts` so I'll run `jekyll server` and BOOM! It finally WORKED! now what? [Contributions](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/rrj-dhuds1/blob/main/community-project/CONTRIBUTION.md)
