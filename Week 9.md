# Week 9

## Programming Language
The programming language I am going to learn will be `Kotlin`, and there are a few reasons that I made this desicion. One of the reasons why, is because I dislike `Java` a whole lot. Well, my dislike for `Java` has exponetially decreased, but its still up there lol. I thought it may be interesting to learn `Kotlin` which is `Java` but :cool:. The primary reason I'll be using this for my community code is that its a required language to learn in `DGL-114`. That, coupled with my past *lack* actions when it comes to submitting work on time, and how I like to overcomplicate things, I've decided it would be best to keep it simple.

One of the languages I would have liked to learn is `Rust`. I don't know much about `Rust`, I've just heard a lot of people talk about it recently and how it's a good language.

## Community
As that one guy from fast and furious 'Vin diesl?' says "[Community]"; I think? The whole idea of joining an open source community shoots my anxiety through the roof, but after reading the [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) I'm a little, excited? Aside from the fact that this article is LOOONNNGG, it's well writen and informative. Hopeful, even. But I'm still at a lose as to what community I want to be apart of. There was this one I saw a few days ago, closer to a week ago thats making webcomponents with Kotlin, but I can't find the repo again. Its also small, with two contributors. They we're not a consideration, but I thought it was interesting. There are also a lot of Chinese kotlin repos on github, just a fun aside. I'm getting a little overwhelmed with looking at all these communities, so I'll just call it here. I didn't get the chance to identify three possible communties and what makes them good, but I did put in an effort to look through the various communities.
